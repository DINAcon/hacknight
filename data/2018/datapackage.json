Our data is important to us, and indeed defines our online identity.\n\nYour Privacy Butler will help you to understand any privacy notices. Simply tell Privacy Butler which data processing is a \u201cno go\u201d for you. It converts the privacy notice into icons that show you immediately whether your desired data protection standard is met or not.\n\n[<img src=\"web/sticker.png\" width=\"256\">](https://github.com/SwissLegalTech)\n\nThis project was started at the [Swiss Legal Tech](http://swisslegal.tech) 2018 hackathon in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. The original challenge idea can be [found here](https://github.com/SwissLegalTech/2018/issues/1).\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can see a screencast of the [working demo here](https://github.com/SwissLegalTech/privacy-butler/blob/master/privacy-butler-demo.gif)\n\n### Backend\n\nThe backend uses Java with Spring Boot 2 and communicates with the Google Cloud Natural Language API.\nYou have to create the credentials yourself in order to be able to communicate with Google Cloud.\n\nFind the backend project files here and instructions to get started in the [legal-hackathon-backend](./legal-hackathon-backend) folder.\n\n### Frontend\n\nThe frontend uses Typescript with Angular 6 and Material Design as a styling framework addition to Angular.\n\nYou can find the frontend project files and build instructions in [legal-hackathon-frontend](./legal-hackathon-frontend).\n\n### Splash\n\nThere is also a static HTML launch page defined in `index.html` with resources in the `web` folder. The design template used is [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net), with [jQuery](https://jquery.org) and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com).\n\nCheck the markup for an Easter egg..and a modest proposal on using schema in META tags to publish web site policy in machine readable form. See our reading list below.  \n\n## Data\n\nWe used the **Google Cloud Natural Language API** in this project for rapid analysis of policy texts. See [Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/quickstart), [NL Samples](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/samples), and [Java samples for Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/tree/master/language/).\n\nYou will need to obtain a developer key from the Cloud API console to use our current backend.\n\nWe also ran a short machine learning classification experiment using an open dataset of opt-out policies from [usableprivacy.org](https://usableprivacy.org/data/) in the **[Keras.io](https://keras.io)** deep learning environment. The results can be seen in a [Python notebook](https://github.com/SwissLegalTech/privacy-butler/blob/master/ml/keras-test.ipynb) made with Jupyter, in the `ml` subfolder.\n\nThe dataset used in the experiment above was one of the ones recommended by [Pribot.org](https://pribot.org/), a project that was a major motivation for our work here. Many thanks to [Dr. Harkous](http://www.hamzaharkous.com/) for feedback to our concept during the hackathon.\n\nWe also considered using [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding/) (see [Fredrik Stenbeck comparison](http://fredrikstenbeck.com/google-natural-language-vs-watson-natural-language-understanding/) - and [OpenNLP at Apache](https://opennlp.apache.org/).\n\n## References\n\nFurther reading, in no particular order.\n\n#### Online policy tools\n\n- https://pribot.org/\n- https://tosdr.org/\n- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacycheck/poobeppenopkcbjejfjenbiepifcbclg?hl=en-US\n\n#### Machine learning\n\n- https://medium.com/datathings/the-magic-of-lstm-neural-networks-6775e8b540cd\n- http://blog.echen.me/2017/05/30/exploring-lstms/\n- https://github.com/ar-ms/lstm-mnist\n\n#### Policy documentation\n\n- https://openscience.adaptcentre.ie/projects/GDPRtEXT/\n- https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/\n- https://ebiquity.umbc.edu/resource/html/id/370/Ontology-for-Data-Privacy-Policy\n- http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/improving-readability-online-privacy-policies-through-doop-domain-ontology-online-privacy\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/SwissLegalTech/privacy-butler","contact_url":"https://github.com/SwissLegalTech/privacy-butler/issues","created_at":"2018-10-19T17:25","download_url":"","event_name":"HACKnight 2018","event_url":"https://hacknight.dinacon.ch/event/3","excerpt":"**Many people are unable to cope with the various privacy notices that we have to deal with on a daily basis.

And yet, despite being labeled under the common \"hackathon\" name, their goals vary greatly. Since hackathons are used as a means for work precarization and free labor, the ambiguity of expectations brews potential misunderstanding among participants and stakeholders.**\r\n\r\nDuring the [workshop on fair co-creation](https://dinacon.ch/sessions/2018/in-pursuit-of-fair-co-creation/) ([online notes](https://hackmd.io/s/HJzVtAEjQ)) at #DINAcon18, we discussed time-bounded collaborative events like hackathons common to many technical communities. With the workshops participants we built - in a collaborative manner - a list of *attractors* and *detractors* for participation in hackathons. This inspired us to, during #hacknight, start putting it together into a flowchart based on this list.\r\n\r\nThe flowchart is a playful* way to describe the metadata that we believe should be exposed by every hackathon in order to provide fair conditions to decide attendance. It may help guide potential hackathon participants about whether they should join or not a specific event, help hackathon organizers consider some of the issues at hand, or just amuse or confuse people.\r\n\r\n(*) *inspired by the [cheeky](https://www.xkcd.com/627/) and [insightful](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Flowcharts) flowcharts of the [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) web comic*\r\n\r\n## Prototype\r\n \r\n<img src=\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/loleg/6dde8d17e530d058dae9e774fab793a4/raw/7e45f9a17e80866ee3889e538e42e9effae36568/diagram.svg?sanitize=true\" width=\"100%\">\r\n\r\n[Full screen](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/loleg/6dde8d17e530d058dae9e774fab793a4/raw/7e45f9a17e80866ee3889e538e42e9effae36568/diagram.svg?sanitize=true)\r\n\r\n# Next steps\r\n\r\nWe will work on refining the design of this and creating a poster edition.

However we recommend setting the document root to ```transport/web/``` and using the provided ```.htaccess``` to route API requests to ```api.php```.\n\nOr you can start it with the PHP's built-in webserver (not recommended for a production setup, but the easy way to get started locally)\n\n```\nphp -S localhost:8000\n```\n\nAnd then access it with [http://localhost:8000/web/api.php](http://localhost:8000/web/api.php)\n\n### Configuration\n\nTo define your own configuration for the API copy the file ```config.php.sample``` to ```config.php``` and override the variables you want to change.\n\n### Statistics\n\nYou can get some basic statistics for the API by configuring a Redis server in your configuration (```$redis```) and have a look at [http://localhost/transport/web/stats.php](http://localhost/transport/web/stats.php).\n\n## Development\n\nXSD for the XML Fahrplan API is available here: [hafasXMLInterface.xsd](hafasXMLInterface.xsd)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Missing package php-xml\n\nIf you're running Ubuntu and `composer install` produces the error message\n\n    Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.\n\nyou can try to install the package `php-xml` using the command\n\n    sudo apt install php-xml\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/OpendataCH/Transport","contact_url":"https://github.com/OpendataCH/Transport/issues","created_at":"2018-10-14T22:12","download_url":"","event_name":"HACKnight 2018","event_url":"https://hacknight.dinacon.ch/event/3","excerpt":"The project provides a simple RESTful API for Swiss train connections and departure times.
