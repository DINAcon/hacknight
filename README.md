The **DINAcon HACKnight** is a way to learn about and contribute to Open Source projects in a hands-on way. This event is open to all, and caters to all levels of technical skill. Our focus will be on all projects nominated and showcased at [DINAcon.ch](http://dinacon.ch/programme), the Swiss digital sustainability conference - other open source/data/hardware projects are welcome. Committers and experts are on hand to guide you through to your first bug report or code commit! 

All Challenges posted at [hacknight.dinacon.ch](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch) are announced at the start. Visit the site to browse activities from previous years.
