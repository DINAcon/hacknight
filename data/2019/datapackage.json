Imagine how many wonderful things didn't happen because funding - which is arguably the oxygen for most organizations - is difficult to sustain.

When requested to flip the disk, insert `BAD_APPLE_DATA.DSK` in the same drive.\r\nHit enter, and enjoy !\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground information\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided to do it after watching the demo from Onslaught on C64. It\r\nsounded sad to me that the Apple didn't run the Bad Apple :-)\r\n\r\nIt was made specifically for the Apple ][+ with floppy disk because\r\nthat's the computer I had when I was a kid. I also chose that machine\r\nbecause of its hardware limitations.\r\n\r\nFor those interested, my code is here, \"as is\".\r\n\r\nIf you're really interested, look at the kmean.py file.  That's the\r\ncompressor. This is what it does:\r\n\r\n1. drop some frames in the original video (chosen wisely)\r\n2. compute the delta between each frame, let's call that d-frames\r\n3. cut each d-frame in 8x8 tiles\r\n4. reduce the set of all tiles of all d-frames using k-means approach\r\n5. use a form of RLE encoding to compress each run of tiles in d-frame (this gives \"stripes\")\r\n6. use a Huffman style dictionary to compress each stripe (Huffman is not practical on \r\n   low performance machines, so I had to make an \"approximation\" to reach a better\r\n   speed/compression balance.\r\n7. store the data on the disk (regular Prodos sectors, not a file)\r\n\r\nSteps 4 and 6 are clearly the more sophisticated ones.\r\n\r\nThe code is not super optimized and neither is the compressor.  Giving\r\nit more time, I think I could improve some more the screen size of the\r\nvideo. For exampme, I have the impression that using 16x16 tiles might\r\nbe more efficient.\r\n\r\n~~If you ever have the opportunity to run it on real Apple, please send\r\nme a video. That would be a very much apprciated gift.~~ It works on real hardware !\r\n\r\nFor those old enough and in the specific niche, I used to be called\r\nThe Wizard of the Imphobia group.

In Bern we are keeping this proud tradition alive through the [Demonights](https://demonights.ch), a regular meet-up in an [underground lab](https://blog.datalets.ch/e-0010/) (save the date: [15.11.19](https://demonights.ch/en/blog/save-the-date-for-demonights-010)). We ran [real-time content workshops](https://forum.opendata.ch/t/27-4-realtime-content-production-workshop/383/1) to introduce people to making their own digital art and music. We are involved in [conservation](https://gotpapers.scene.org/), support open [platforms](https://github.com/demozoo/) and their [APIs](https://twitter.com/conspiracyhu/status/1142499887940022272). All this begs the question of what we can do to encourage open source efforts to help keep underground electronic art accessible to the next generation.\r\n\r\n<span title=\"Beginner challenge\" class=\"challenge-badge level-1\"/>\r\n\r\nBring the demoscene to the HACKnight by putting on some scene productions on your laptop or the beamer, tuning in to the music and art of the electronic underground. There are some [introductions here](https://blog.datalets.ch/tag/demoscene/) and lots more to be found all around the 'net, for example: [Teach Yourself Demoscene in 14 Days](https://github.com/psenough/teach_yourself_demoscene_in_14_days)\r\n\r\n<span title=\"Intermediate challenge\" class=\"challenge-badge level-2\"/>\r\n\r\nMake some noise with a software synth, create some procedural art in code, tie it all together with a demotool. The HACKnight is a good excuse as any to doodle with generative tools. Check out our [workshop post](https://forum.opendata.ch/t/27-4-realtime-content-production-workshop/383/1) for some waypoints.\r\n\r\n<span title=\"Pro challenge\" class=\"challenge-badge level-3\"/>\r\n\r\nWith a focus on the open source community, suggest what frameworks and tools we should support and promote in upcoming events. [github/demoscene](https://github.com/topics/demoscene) is a good starting point for this. Even better, share the code to your own production, even if it's a \"party prod\" (i.e. made on location).

Hacking and politics have never been such bedbuddies as this year, which saw the first [Swiss Twitter referendum](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/directdemocracy/ahead-of-the-2019-elections_recruiting-voters-to-be-part-of-the-campaign/44241152), the launch of the [Democracy Foundation](https://forum.opendata.ch/t/14-09-direct-science-for-direct-democracy/568/6?u=oleg), and the globally discussed [E-voting Project](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/e-voting_these-are-the-arguments-that-sank-e-voting-in-switzerland/45136608). So it's no surprise that many of us in the Swiss open source and data community have been involved in projects working with political data this year. \r\n\r\nInspired by the [BFS Elections 2019 OGD announcement](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/services/ogd/elections-2019.html), this challenge is to make something with the new Open Government Data (OGD) service for the upcoming federal election.\r\n\r\nDuring the HACKnight, we swapped ideas with a member of the [Freedomvote](https://github.com/freedomvote/freedomvote) team covering of the elections, who have an issue up to [use this new data](https://github.com/freedomvote/freedomvote/issues/274). Check out https://ch19.freedomvote.ch/\r\n\r\n_Image: Oleg Lavrovsky via [Opendata.ch blog](https://opendata.ch/2018/11/bundesrat-beschliesst-strategie-fuer-open-government-data-2019-2023/) CC BY 4.0_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### <center>{ hacknight challenges }</center>\r\n\r\n<span title=\"Beginner challenge\" class=\"challenge-badge level-1\"/>\r\n\r\nThe first challenge is to come up with ideas of what election data can actually be used for. Research the topic of election monitoring, compile a community-run list of awesome apps, visualizations, data journalism and research projects on the topic. One starting point could be the [2015 Hackdays](http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/event:2015-09) from the previous elections. Use this to decide what would be the best approach to using the new data.\r\n\r\n<span title=\"Intermediate challenge\" class=\"challenge-badge level-2\"/>\r\n\r\nFor the upcoming Elections, the data is already available in zeroed form, so the first step is to find it on the [opendata.swiss portal](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/eidg-wahlen-2019/), download it in one of the national languages, check the OGD licensing terms and technical conditions of the data.\r\n\r\n<span title=\"Pro challenge\" class=\"challenge-badge level-3\"/>\r\n\r\nSwitzerland's highest ranked dataset in the, now rather out of date but still usable, [Global Open Data Index](https://index.okfn.org/) is its [Election Results](https://index.okfn.org/place/ch/elections/). This is an important area of open data activism. Find out how comprehensively election results are being published at other government levels, such as the cantonal and municipal level, or other processes, such as referendums. Research existing initiatives and see if they have open source projects or need community support in some way. Propose a strategy for the community to monitor and make use of OGD related to the democratic process in the years to come. Petition key institutions such as Opendata.ch, Parldigi, BFS for support by organizing a fundraiser and roadmap.","maintainer":"loleg","name":"Monitoring the Elections","phase":"Ask","progress":-1,"score":0,"source_url":"","summary":"Code for Switzerland as the country goes to the polls","team":"loleg","updated_at":"2019-10-21T09:59","url":"https://hacknight.dinacon.ch/project/26","webpage_url":"https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/services/ogd/elections-2019.html"},{"autotext":"# Smart Use - Land, Growth and Big Data\n\n_[README auf Deutsch](README.de.md)_\n\nA web application for collecting and sharing maps powered by a Geospatial Data Package API. Part of Smart Use, a pilot land use mapping project focusing on the greater metropolitan area around Zurich, Switzerland. The growth of the economy and demographics has until now required the continued expansion of infrastructure and settlement space. The sustainable transformation of urban landscapes can only succeed today, however, when spatial development transitions from a \"hardware-oriented\" planning of offers, to a \"software-oriented\" approach in land use management.\n\nQuestions about the development of human settlement are answered to a large degree by the tender planning process. Part of a [cooperation program](http://www.metropolitanraum-zuerich.ch/themen/kooperationsprogramm.html), the *[Smart Use](http://smartuse.ch)* project aims to focus settlement development more strongly on the actual behaviour of land users, and therefore with new data sources to better understand their actual demand. The daily routines between home, working and leisure time are to be examined in the entire region, with a focus on the quality and the intensity of use of public spaces, streets and open areas.\n\nFor more information and to see the platform in action, please visit [smartuse.ch](https://smartuse.ch)\n\nFurther reading:\n\n- [README for backend application](INSTALL.md)\n- [README for static frontend](static/README.md)\n- [Technical Report](docs/README.md)\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/smartuse/platform","contact_url":"https://github.com/smartuse/platform/issues","created_at":"2019-10-18T16:38","download_url":"","event_name":"HACKnight 2019","event_url":"https://hacknight.dinacon.ch/event/4","excerpt":"We have been working on this project for the past year, in cooperation with a Swiss association that promotes exchange on the topic of urban planning and policy.

Among them our thanks to [Open Data Zurich](https://dinacon.ch/sessions/2019/partizipation-und-open-data-in-der-smart-city-zuerich-ein-werkstattbericht/) and [Adfinsys](https://dinacon.ch/sessions/2019/elektronische-baugesuche-open-source-und-innovation-in-schweizer-kantonen/) for their workshops on these topics. We would like to know what the community here thinks of projects like this, and whether the urban data discussion is something you would like to help us to take to the next level with better tools and collective efforts. More thoughts on this have been posted in the [Opendata.ch Forum](https://forum.opendata.ch/t/smart-use-a-new-project-for-urbanists/561/1).\r\n\r\nAt the HACKnight, our team worked on the [QField](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch/project/32) and [OpenCollective](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch/project/31) projects.
